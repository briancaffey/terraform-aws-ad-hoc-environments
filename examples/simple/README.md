# Simple Example

This example includes a standard example of how to use the terraform configuration.

This terraform configuration is designed to be used with [`terraform-aws-django`](https://github.com/briancaffey/terraform-aws-django). The example here is used in a repo called [https://github.com/briancaffey/django-step-by-step](https://github.com/briancaffey/django-step-by-step).

The `django-step-by-step` repo uses common infrastructure created in this example along with the `terraform-aws-django` repo which is used to create ad hoc environments that are built on top of the common infrastructure.
